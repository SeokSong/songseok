				Hello, my name is Seok Jun Song (I mostly go by Seok). A little about me is I was originally born in South Korean however my family immigrated to the United States of America when I was around 5.
				I am currently a Junior studing Computer Science and Economics at the University of Colorado at Boulder. I originally started as a Biology major, however the summer before my freshmen year
				I heard something about computer science so I decided to take an intro course for fun. I instantly knew it was something I wanted to do in the future and changed majors. I am
				currently most intrested in Data Science and Software Engineering as a career. A little about my personal life, I used to swim and run in highschool, and both are things I
				enjoy doing in my free time. I have also found a passion for photography and videographer, which aligns perfectly with my job; I currently work as a football videographer for
				CU's football team. I have listed some (but not all) of my favorite project I have currently done up to this point below. I hope you enjoy :)

		  <p>CU Sprint was a group effort for a class project. CU Sprint is a Mario style/inspired 2D platformer. It was built on Unity 2D using C#. The idea behind the game
			was to create a enjoyable and difficult platformer with various different levels and styles of obsacles so it would stay fresh throughout the game. The game has 6
		levels, with an inital level selector. It was designed so that you can die every other level, starting on level 2. So that means you can die on 2, 4 and 6. </p>

	    <p>This was my first every decent size project. I was created a single player version of Uno that is run on terimal. I created 3 different bots that will all play differently
			Bot 1 will play randomly, he will play based on the first card that can be played. Bot 2 thinks a little bit more, he will look at his whole deck before making a decison. Bot
		3 will play the smartest, he will look at his whole deck, the number of cards in everyones hand and he also knows what cards everyone else has. The bots are very "iffy"; however I fully
	plan on revisitng this project once I learn more about machine learning so my bots can rely on more than if statements, and also so I can create an actual UI and host it somewhere.
This project was written in C++. </p>

	    <p>This was a partner project with Katelyn Singh (<a href="https://github.com/singhkatelyn"> https://github.com/singhkatelyn </a>). Together we created a scaled down version
			of New York (15ish blocks). This project can only be run on MacOS due to the coloring tool we used. The way our map works is, you input your current location (while looking at a map)
		and where you will like to go. Then we will provide directions with a color coated map, and then print out a list of businness and attractions near the final location. This map is not accurate
	as it does not take in real time data. The purpose of this porject was to demostrate the ability to use data strucutres and algrothms such as dijkstra's. The whole project was written in C++ </p>
